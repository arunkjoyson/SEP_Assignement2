### Problem Statement:

The AI developer client uses web scraping to collect training data for AI models. However, they face two main challenges:

- Developers want to have categorized training questions that are separate from the answers because developers care about self-affirmation.
- Developers want to know that the training data they are using is “balanced” (does not contain biases) because this will give them better AI models

### Q) Analysis of current 2 requirements: 

### Requirement 1: Categorized Training Questions & Answers

As an AI developer, I want training questions to be categorized separately from answers so that I can ensure self-affirmation.

## Assumption:

- Developers benefit from self-affirmation when questions and answers are separated.

- Categorization improves retrieval, filtering, and dataset usability.

## Validation:

- Ask developers how often they struggle with mixed question-answer data when using training datasets.

- Do you think Determine whether categorization improves searchability and organization in AI training ? 

Follow-Up Questions
	
	- What methods were tried before to organise ?

	- What are the common categories you think are good?

- Do you  actively use datasets with separate questions and answers to measure self-affirmation impact.

- Do you think categorization is enough to fix this issue?

## Preliminary Tasks:

- [ ] Identify common categories of training questions (e.g., programming, mathematics, general knowledge).

- [ ] Review existing training datasets to understand their current format and structure.

- [ ] Interview developers to assess whether question-answer separation improves their workflow.

- [ ] Explore possible UI/UX designs for a better categorization system.

- [ ] If categorization alone isn’t enough, identify the simplest technology to enhance organization.

## Metrics for Success:

- Accuracy of categorization: >95%.

- Processing Speed: Categorization time of <500ms per question.

- Developer Feedback: >80% satisfaction rate on data organization.

## Outcome:

- A structured system where training questions are categorized and separate from answers, improving usability for developers.
