### Problem Statement:

The AI developer client uses web scraping to collect training data for AI models. However, they face two main challenges:

1.Developers want to have categorized training questions that are separate from the answers because developers care about self-affirmation.
2.Developers want to know that the training data they are using is “balanced” (does not contain biases) because this will give them better AI models
